## Getting Started
* [AeroGear Push Plugin Guide](http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/aerogear-cordova/AerogearCordovaPush/)

## Run tests

1. Use your existing cordova app, or create a new one.
1. Add the plugin and the tests:

  ```bash
  cordova plugin add https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-cordova-push.git
  cordova plugin add https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-cordova-push.git#:/tests
  ```

1. Add this plugin:
  ```bash
  cordova plugin add http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-plugin-test-framework.git
  ```
1. Change the start page in `config.xml` with `<content src="cdvtests/index.html" />` or navigate to cdvtests/index.html from within your app.

## Documentation

For more details about the current release, please consult [our documentation](https://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-cordova/).

## Android notification icon

To show a better notification icon in Android Lollipop and above, create a transparent icon and name the file as "icon_white.png" and put into platforms/android/res/drawable folder.

## Configuring Firebase Version

Many other plugins require Google Play Services and/or Firebase libraries. This is a common source of Android build-failures, since the library version must be aligned to the same version for all plugins. Use the `FIREBASE_VERSION` to align the required firebase-messaging version with other plugins.

For example:

```
cordova plugin add aerogear-cordova-push --variable FIREBASE_VERSION=11.8.0
```
